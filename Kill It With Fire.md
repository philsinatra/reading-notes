## Quotes & concepts

Most people don't care how healthy a piece of technology is as long as it performs the function they need it to with a reasonable degree of accuracy in a time frame that doesn't exhaust their patience. "Good enough" reigns supreme.

Technical debt, performance issues, and system stability.

Consumers can't determine the value of technology they're invested in.

Is the technology serving the needs of its users?

It's more difficult to misinterpret information and feedback when it's in the form of inconvenience, disruption, interruptions, and additional work.

## Code Yellow

A cross-functional team is created to tackle an issue critical to operational excellence.

The Code Yellow leader has escalated privileges. The leader gets to commandeer any and all resources needed for the Code Yellow effort. This includes people, rooms, offices, et cetera. The leader can pull resources off of other teams without approval from the normal chain of command and without length explanations or discussion.

The leader serves as the central point of contact for the effort. The organization may not know the full scope of the issue when declaring the Code Yellow. By creating a central point of contact, teams across the organization can refer issues to the Code Yellow leader and receive clear and specific guidance.

The team is small. Team composition may change as the leader pulls in experts from other teams and releases them, but the team at any one point stays less than eight people. The people on the team must be able to implement solutions; they are not simply representatives from other teams.

The Code Yellow is temporary. Before declaring a Code Yellow, the organization should set success criteria. At what level of improvement is the situation no longer critical and the remaining work can be placed on the road maps of existing teams with proper prioritization? A Code Yellow guarantees that only urgently needed resources will be commandeered and that they will be returned as soon as the crisis is over. The temporary nature of a Code Yellow is what helps conquer the political rivalries that otherwise make systemic problems harder to solve.

## Failure drills

Is it better to wait a something to fail and hope you have the right resources and experts at the ready? Or is it better to trigger failure at a time when you can plar resources, expertise, and impact in advance? You don't know that same thing doesn't work the way you intended it to until you try it.
