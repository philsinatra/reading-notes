[Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1675435077&sr=8-1) is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.

## Average is over

Technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and organizations are lagging behind. For many workers, this lag predicts bad news. As intelligent machines improve, and the gap between machine and human abilities shrinks, employers are becoming increasingly likely to hire "new machines" instead of "new people." And when only a human will do, improvements in communications and collaboration technology are making remote work easier than ever before, motivating companies to outsource key roles to stars - leaving the local talent pool underemployed. (p.23)

### High-skilled workers

Advances such as robotics and voice recognition are automating many low-skilled positions. People with the ability to work with and extract results from advanced systems and machinery will thrive. The key question is "Are you good at working with intelligent machines?"

### Superstars

In areas where technology makes remote work possible, the talent market is made universally accessible. Therefore, those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer. "Hearing a succession of mediocre singers does not add up to a single outstanding performance." In a marketplace where the consumer has access to all performers, and everyone's skill level (_q_) is clear, the consumer will choose the very best.

### Owners

The final group that will thrive in our new economy consists of those with capital to invest in teh new technologies that are driving the economic reconstruction.

## Two core abilities for thriving in the new economy

1. The ability to quickly master hard things.
2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

Deep work helps you quickly learn hard things. Deliberate practice requires (1) your attention to be focused tightly on a specific skill you're trying to improve or an idea you're trying to master; (2) you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it's most productive. (p.35)

Scientists increasingly believe that myelin - a layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows cells to fire faster and cleaner is a biological key in the process of deep learning. You get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around the relevant neurons, allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively.
