## Quotes and concepts

> "Many people suppose that computing machines are replacements for intelligence and have cut down the need for original thought. This is not the case. The more powerful the computer, the greater the premium that will be placed on connecting it with imaginative, creative, high-level human thinking." - Professor Norbert Wiener

> "Man-Computer Symbiosis - The hope is that, in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled together very tightly, and that the resulting partnership will think as no human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know today" - J.C.R. Licklider

> "To pour forth benefits for the common good is divine..." - Benjamin Franklin
