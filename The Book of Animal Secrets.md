## Living in a zoo cage

Animals have adapted to the fears they face, enabling them to live an optimized life. They don't look as if they are in high-alert mode all the time; even animals that are prey for others can spend much of their day lolling about. Lions fear death every day in their own way. Still, for the most part, they do not ponder their mortality like we do or lament yesterday's letdowns and worry incessantly about tomorrow's to-do list.

The World Health Organization has deemed chronic stress the "Health Epidemic of the 21st Century". Wild animals show us to live in the moment. Some domesticated animals are great examples of the value of living with minimal anxiety and reduced stress levels.

Wild animals may not have the benefits of modern technology, but neither do they suffer from diseases of civilization. All creatures must jump into alert mode when threatened. But humans have a tendency to let stress get the best of us and keep us rigged for battle when there's nothing really to fight other than insomnia, cravings for junk food, and a weakness for the couch. We would do well to manage healthy levels of transient stress (including indulging in the occasional "safe scare"), respect our physiology to maintain good posture, move frequently as if our breath relied on it, and eat as close to nature as possible.

Remember your inner fish: don't drink like one, but do glide through the world upright with a strong core that supports your center of gravity, promotes ideal posture, and helps prevent atrophy of bones and muscles. Watch out for signs of metabolic syndrome, all of which are modifiable and treatable. These basic tenets will help us to adapt to our modern environment and enjoy living in our collective, cozy zoo.

## Oh my dog!

Dogs are more than man's best friend. They are models for human medicine, sometimes mirrors to ourselves, and masterful mentors of well-being. Perhaps no other species can tell us to live in the moment, jump for joy when happy, engage in playtime daily, stay curious and seek new experiences, be observant and on guard for dangerous situations, act affectionately and friendly even toward strangers, and drink lots of water.

The leash is a two-way street: health can travel both ways, and we can learn from dogs in carefully designed research settings too. We can also learn to hack our sleep when traveling and sleep less like a dog to get the restful sleep we need. Although pre-dog wolves likely cozied up to us eons ago as they scavenged around garbage dumps on the edge of human settlements, we've since co-evolved long enough to know we need each other. And despite the demands that dog ownership places on us, the benefits of dog ownership are infinite and infinitely welcome.

## Take the long way home

Three lessons from studies with pigeons can add to our productivity and quality of life.

First, _boost your perceptual intuition by paying close attention to patterns in your world_. By tuning in to these patterns daily, you can build memories in general, speed up your brain's processing, and increase the chances that you'll make good decisions. Try going outside for ten minutes every day and come back with at least ten patterns you spotted.

Second, _take a step back when making important decisions because your humanness can be a hindrance_. Your gut response is tremendously important, especially when you need to make quick, semisubconscious decisions. Realize that it's not always driven only by pure data - and your memories can change with time and be influenced by your emotions, altering your recollection of past experiences. Sleep on important decisions. A new day gives new perspective, allowing us to think a bit more like a pigeon - with less emotion and more logic or rules based on what we've learned repeatedly to be the "right" answer. When an important decision is at hand, write down the possibilities and the underlying premises behind each available choice. This will help to remove the bias (cognitive dissonance) that is in all of us and may yeild a more appropriate decision.

Third, _when you have an encounter you want to remember, jot down the basic details rather than minutiae_. Making simple summary notes from each encounter or meeting helps us remember events better. The more we expand and stumulate our brain, the better chance we have at a long and healthy life. This stimulation doesn't have to be picking up a new language, mastering pointillism, or reading about the theory of relativity. Novel and engaging experiences can work wonders, and challenging yourself every day can have important benefits.
