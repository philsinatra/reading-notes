## Expect it to be hard

A key characteristic that separates allostasis, the new and more accurate model of change, from homeostasis, the old model, is that allostasis has an anticipatory component: whereas homeostasis is agnostic to expectations, allostasis states that expectations shape our experience.

Happiness at any given moment is a function of your reality minus your expectations.

Our culture pushes us to wear rose-tinted glasses and "think positive," but we have a better chance at feeling and doing good if we set realistic expectations - including that things change all the time, sometimes for better and sometimes for worse.

Our brains constantly try to predict what will happen next and then align those predictions with reality - when our predictions are off, we benefit from updating them as swiftly as possible.

There are numerous advantages to cultivating an outlook of tragic optimism, realizing that life contains inevitable pain and suffering yet moving forward with grace and grit.

When confronted with significant challenges, instead of being a Pollyanna or wallowing in despair and nihilism, both of which are maladaptive, do what you can to commit to wise hope and wise action. _Like it or not, this is what is happening right now; I will focus on what I can control, do the best I can, and come out the other side._

Suffering equals pain time resistance; the more you can shed your resistance, the exponentially better you'll feel and do.

## Create a fluid sense of self

Your core values are the principles by which you live; they serve as the rugged boundaries of your identity, guiding how you differentiate, integrate, and navigate your path.

It is good to have three to five core values. Define each in specific terms and devise a few ways you can practice each in daily life.

When you feel the ground shifting underneath you, when you don't know your next move, you can ask yourself, _How might I move in the direction of my core values?_ Or, if that isn't possible, you might consider, _How might I protect them?_

Flexibility is about continually adjusting how you practice and apply your core values in ways that are true to yourself and in harmony with your changing circumstances.

It is normal for your core values to change over time. Navigating the world using your current core values is what guides you to discover your new ones.

"Early plasticity, later rigidity" means that values-driven actions are particularly important during periods of change and disorder; they have an outsize impact in shaping the future.

## Respond, not react

Growth and meaning unfold on their own schedule; we need to give our psychological immune systems time to process the significant changes and disruptions in our lives.

Our perception of time slows during difficulties; just knowing this helps us to be patient and persist; what feels awful today almost certainly won't feel as bad in far-off tomorrows.

Though we cannot force meaning and growth, a few concrete tactics can help us to usher them in:

- Practice humility and surrender, which does not mean doing nothing but releasing from the need to fix or control unfixable or uncontrollable situations.
- Ask for and receive help: beware of getting pulled into the vortex of extreme optimization and productivity at the expense of nurturing friendships and building community.
- Practice voluntary simplicity, develop routines, and create rituals.
- Separate real fatigue from fake fatigue - remember that the former calls for rest, and the latter calls for nudging yourself into action.
- Do what you can to let your suffering become compassion for yourself and others.

With each major cycle of order, disorder, and reorder that we navigate, the next one becomes a little easier.

## Embracing change

- Where in your life are you pursuing fixity where opening yourself to the possibility (or inevitability) of change might be beneficial?
- In what parts of your life are you holding on to unrealistic expectations?
- Are there elements of your identity to which you cling too tightly?
- How might you use your core values to navigate the challenges in your life?
- In what circumstances do you tend to react when you would benefit from responding, and what conditions predispose you to that?

## Develop rugged flexibility

1. **Embrace non-dual thinking**. 
   While some things in life truly are either/or, many are both/and. _Is this view or approach helping me right now?_ If the answer is yes, keep using it. If the answer is no, then shift, realizing that your answer will probably evolve over time.
2. **Adopt a _being_ orientation**.
   A _having_ orientation means defining yourself by what you have; thus, you are inherently fragile since those objects, identities, and pursuits can be taken away. A _being_ orientation means you identify with the deepest and most enduring parts of yourself; your core values and ability to respond to circumstances.
3. **Frequently update your expectations to match reality.**
   The human brain functions like a prediction machine constantly trying to anticipate reality. You feel (and do) best when your reality is aligned with, or perhaps slightly better than, your expectations. _Here is what I was hoping for or thought would happen. Here is what is actually happening. Since I live not only in my own head but also in reality, I need to focus on the latter._
4. **Practice tragic optimism, commit to wise hope, and take wise action.**
   > ...accept the world on its terms without giving up the belief that you can change the world. That's a successful adulthood - the maturation of your thought process and very soul to the point where you understand the limits of life without giving up on its possibilities. - Bruce Springsteen
   _ This is what is happening now, so I will focus on what I can control and do the best I can. I've faced other challenges and seasons of doubt and despair and come out the other side._ Remember that hope is most important when it is hard to hold on to it.
5. **Actively differentiate and integrate your sense of self.**
   Complexity is crucial for persisting through periods of change and disorder. Think about your life's distinct elements and how they work together. How can you mold the distinct parts of your identity into a cohesive narrative?
6. **View the world with independent and interdependent lenses.**
   An independent view is advantageous when you want to make something happen and have a high degree of control. An interdependent view is advantageous when you are in a more chaotic environment. Think non-dually.
7. **Respond to change with the 4Ps.**
   *Pause* - give your immediate emotions room to breathe.
   *Process* - understand what is happening.
   *Plan* - reflect and strategize using your brain's most evolved and uniquely human parts.
   *Proceed* - move forward with your plan, adjusting as needed.
   The biggest barriers to proceeding are self-doubt and paralysis by analysis. The best way to overcome them is to treat your first moves as experiments. Lower the bar from needing to take the absolutely right or perfect action to try something new and learning from it.
8. **Lean on routines (and rituals) to provide stability during periods of disorder.**
   Routines offer a sense of predictability and stability when everything around you is changing.
9. **Use behavioral activation.**
   ...action can create motivation, especially when stuck in a rut. Sometimes we need more, and sometimes we need less. Even the little things require more when we're in a rut, and that's okay. It may take some extra work to overcome the initial static and friction. But the laws of physics apply to our minds, too: the more we get going, the easier it becomes.
10. **Don't force meaning and growth; let them come on their own time.**
    During life's most significant challenges, give your psychological immune system the necessary time and space to marshal an appropriate response. Showing up and getting through is enough. Be kind and patient with yourself - hard as it may be - and do what you can to lean on others for support.
